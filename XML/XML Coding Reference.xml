<!-- XML Coding Refernce.xml -->

<!-- XML stands for "eXtensible Markup Language". -->
<!-- XML was designed to store and transport data. -->
<!-- XML separates its information from a view. -->
<!-- XML is an underlying data layer that can be used behind HTML, CSS, and JS for its presentation. -->
<!-- XML is a good abstraction layer that allows an application to send only data, rather than data and tags (like with HTML). -->
<!-- XML can also be used as the lower level data layer for a database system rather then a relational SQL server. -->
<!-- XML has no "pre-defined" tags like HTML does. You use custom named tags to express specific descriptions of internal data for better readability. -->
<!-- XML is a tree structure, unlike SQL relational databses which rely on table structure(s). -->
