### Summary:

Ansible is a tool that uses Inastructure as Code (IaC) to automate provisioning, configuration, and management of infastructure. It is mainly a configuration tool. Once provisioning is done, Ansible is typically used to configure infastructure, deploy applications, install/update software, etc. It is similar to that of another infastructure tool called Terraform, but Ansible is more mature, while Terraform is relatively new, still changing, and much more advanced for infastructure orchestration.
