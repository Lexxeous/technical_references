On September 9th, 1947, computer scientist Grace Hopper found a dead moth in a relay of Harvard University’s Mark II electromechanical computer and reported the world’s first literal computer bug. However, the term “bug”, in the sense of technical error, dates back at least to 1876 inside of Thomas Edison's notebooks. In 1873 Edison first confronted what he later called a bug when he began developing a quadruplex telegraph system to transmit and receive up to four separate telegrams on a single wire simultaneously.
